Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing body mass (kg) by the square of its length in meters. The ideal weight is obtained by multiplying the desired BMI by the square of the length.

The table showing the BMI and body weight values ​​for adults aged 19-24 is as follows:

Age group BMI range Classification
19-24 -20 Poor
19-24 20 to 24.9 Normal
19-24 25-29.9 Slightly fat
19-24 30 to 34.9 Fat
19-24 35-44,9 Important for health
19-24 45-49.9 Excessive fat
19-24 +49,9 Morbid (fatal) fat
There may be an increase in body mass index as the age progresses.

Appropriate body mass index values ​​by age are as follows:

Age Ideal BMI
19-24 19-24
25-34 20-25
35-44 21-26
45-54 22-27
55-65 23-28
+65 24-29
Body Mass Index (BMI) = Body Weight (kg.) / Square of the length (m.)
Ideal Weight = BMI value desired to be reached {\ displaystyle \ times} {\ displaystyle \ times} Square of height
• Sample Ideal Weight = 24 {\ displaystyle \ times} {\ displaystyle \ times} (1.60 {\ displaystyle \ times} {\ displaystyle \ times} 1.60) = 61.4 kg

How is body surface area calculated?
Body surface area is linked to weight and height. 
If you are curious about the total outer surface area of ​​your body in space, you can calculate it with this tool. 
The m2 I calculate is of course a theoretical calculation.
The exact area of ​​the body can only be calculated using the necessary software by transferring this three-dimensional data to the computer environment after scanning the body with a three-dimensional scanning device.
